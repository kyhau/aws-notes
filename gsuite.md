# G Suite

## Drive

1. Drive stores at most 4,000 items or 5GB of data offline.

1. You can restore a given user's deleted Google Drive files for a date range you specify, as long as the Drive files were deleted within the past 25 days.

1. If a user provides others with access to any Drive item, when you restore that item, the access is not restored. The user can re-enable access as needed.

1. By default, each user with a G Suite account has 30 GB of storage available for uploaded Google Drive files, Gmail, and Google+ photos. Users with the free edition of G Suite (or consumer accounts) get 15 GB of storage.
